# Programming with JS
 
## Control flow is the order which the code is executed by the computer 
The code is usually run in the order first line but in certain structures that changes the control flow like conditionals and loops, IF statements ,for loops,while ,do while for example where they change how they code is run .
 
 **JavaScript Operators**

We can assign values to variables and do logical operation on them

**example :**

let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y; 
Or multiply them 
let z = x * y;
 
We can also assign String to variables 

let x = “Hello”;

let y = “world”;

let z = x + “  ” + y ;

There’s many ways we can use these operators like in loops and if statements to do cooler stuff with our code. 

 
**JavaScript Functions**

It allows us to wrap the steps of a functions together and make something close to a method in java and we call it to do that function

**example :**

function myFunction(p1, p2) {

  return p1 * p2;
  
}

myFunction(p1, p2);

myFunction will return me the multiply of the parameters p1,p2.
