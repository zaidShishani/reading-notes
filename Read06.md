# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Little bit of CSS
It help us to find ways to make our website more aesthetic by allowing us to edit the overall appearance of the website and the structure of the texts and the elements such as imagines and bottoms and their layouts. 

**How do we add css**

There is 3 ways we can insert css 

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS

**CSS syntax**

 example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

Code:

h1 {

    color: red;

    font-size: 5em;
}

**CSS color property**
We have different ways of adding color

* HEX value
* RGB value
* RGBA value
* HSL value
* HSLA value

HEX value example:

body {color: #92a8d1;}

RGB value example:

body {color: rgb(201, 76, 76);}

RGBA value example:

body {color: rgba(201, 76, 76, 0.6);}

HSL value example:

body {color: hsl(89, 43%, 51%);}

HSLA value example:

body {color: hsla(89, 43%, 51%, 0.6);}

**So what is the goal of CSS**

Why we would even do all this changes to our website 

It is so easier to our eyes and more engine with the user and not boring to look at.
