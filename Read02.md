**Brief history**

Git is based on an open sources software project DVCs named bitKeeper in 2002 ,buty in 2005 the deves stopped using the DVCs due to problems with the community and bitKeeper and start on working to create the own DVCs which allowed for nonlinear development from multiple branches and possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption since then git has become the most used DVCs in the world.

**So what is Git**

Is a DVCs that stores data in a snapshots references any changes if made if not it will replicate an identical version of it there are 3 stages for git and they are:
