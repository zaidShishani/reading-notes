# **Growth mindset**

## **Summary**
Growth mindset is about putting a conscious effort to improving your qualities to be able to face bigger challenges by improving from your previous obstacles,We gonna face setbacks things will get difficult and we will want to “take a break” watch a clip on youtube or use social media  to get that instant gratification or we wouldn’t have enough motivation to continue then and there  we should take a set back and a breath and push through and we shouldn’t view our coworkers as our opponent or someone we must overcome but rather a teammate that build each other up to improve and not take criticism as a personal attack but as tips we can use to overcome the obstacle so we can tackle new challenges.
